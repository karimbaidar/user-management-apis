# frontend

Please note that due to time constraints, I wasnt able to go for all the posibilities. 

## Project setup

To make changes in the frontend, you can easily modify the Dockerfile, allowing for flexibility and customization.

## Package.json

To keep things organized, I've listed important packages with version control in our package.json file. This version control helps maintain consistency and reliability in our project.

## Tailwind 
For custom configuration to tailwind,    you can use tailwind.config.js

## First Iteration

1. For the first iteration, I tried my level best to provide best features. 
2. Created and used reusable generic components throghout the project. 
3. Tried to use generic utility functions.  
4. Used Prettier for better formatting of the code. 
5. Tried to use Composition API throughout the project as it is more flexible as compoare to options API. but I am not restricted to only use composition API :). 
6. As it was not specified on how to input the avatars, so I used external api for the avators to load from 


### Second Iteration
1. We might introduce Authentication based on JWT token and permissions.
2. use pinia for state/store management and user state and auth and other.... Refer to this : https://vuex.vuejs.org/
3. use loading for the List as I already have used for userDetail but for list it is  also important for seemless user experience. 
4. Didnt use Typescript extensively except for utility classes...
5. Playwright might be integrated for better writing of frontend tests. I personally like it. 
6. Will use Swagger though.
7. BASIC CRUD has to be followed for the list items.
8. many others ....


### Images
 - Few screenshots of the frontend of app are stored in assets folder. I know it is not necessary but still, I would add it.
